Make sure you have access by then.  3. A Learning Journal  Because of the experiential design of this course, students should keep a written Learning Journal to record concepts, ideas, insights, etc.  This can be electronic, but research shows that writing supports more insightful learning and better recall.  Not your notes from this class, a Learning Journal is a supplemental form of recording ideas as well as your own thoughts and lessons from lectures, group research and meetings, group presentations, class exercises, etc.  Your instructor may, from time to time, ask you about your Learning Journal.  Because your notes are private, any sharing of content will be completely voluntary on your part.  V. Course Grading  Grading for the course includes three components: Exams (45%), a group project (30%) and class participation (25%).  Each component is detailed below: Exams (45 points total) There will be three exams, each worth 15 pts. The exams may be a combination of case analysis, essay questions and/or multiple-choice questions.  Exams may ', 'Syllabus  Bus Mgt 4240 Managing Innovation - Spring 2017    4 cover lectures, text material or other assigned readings, videos or class discussions.  Exams may be cumulative, although the primary focus of each will be on specified content.  No make-up, late or early exams will be given, except in the case of medical emergency.   Students should consult the course schedule for this semester make arrangements before the semester begins to avoid time conflicts. Group Projects (30 points total) Completion of this course involves a group project.  Students collaborate inside and outside of class to identify a service, product, or process innovation and develop their idea.   The purpose of the group project is to allow you to apply (and expand on) the ideas you have learned in an area that is of special interest to you.  Each group will develop an idea for a new product, service, or process starting from idea This should include primary and secondary research to provide feedback on your idea and support design, development, and launch plans.  Examples of past projects include a 3D printing consulting company, an educational program for hospitalized children, or a mobile app to buy / sell vacant or vacated sports or concert seats. Groups consist of up to 5 students.  Groups will be formed and begin the first week of class.  Some form of primary research is required, so you need to plan accordingly for data collection and analysis.  You are also encouraged to continuously check with me regarding the project scope and deliverables.  Three different components of your group project will be graded: a. Two project updates (5 pts each, class feedback)    b. 10 pts, class and instructor evaluation) c. Final written project report (10 pts, instructor evaluation) The Project Handbook (available on Canvas) has detailed information on deliverables and timing.  Note that presentation grades are based on class feedback so you should design your presentation accordingly.  The final group presentation may involve other students, faculty, or industry representatives.    ', 'Syllabus  Bus Mgt 4240 Managing Innovation - Spring 2017    5 Class Participation (25 points total) Experiential learning involves collaboration.   So, this course requires students to prepare, attend, and contribute to class discussion and exercises.  Text, articles, and mini-cases should be read in advance of class.    Participation scores are based on three elements:  Learning Catalytics scores, a Confidential Assessment, and your Class Journal.  a. Learning Catalytics (a web-based collaboration and learning platform) will be the primary source used to evaluate your attendance, participation, and feedback.  You may miss up to three (3) classes throughout the semester without negatively impacting your grade.  However, because Learning Catalytics will be used to provide feedback on group presentations you should plan to attend classes during all scheduled presentations in addition to all exams. b. At the end of the semester, each group member will be required to turn in a Confidential Assessment of their own contribution as well as the contributions of each of their other group members.  These assessments will count for individual participation and contribution scores and be used to modify the individual group member grades where obvious differences in effort and participation amongst group members can be substantiated.  c. Participation scores will be supported your own Learning  Journal.  I may review your journal from time to time during the semester to inform my observations of your class contributions.   IV. Honor Code & Disability Accommodations Any use of case analyses or any other material in any format from other sections of this course or any course taught at any time in the past or present will be considered a violation of the honor code.  The Ohio State University and the Committee on Academic Code of Student Conduct, and that all students will complete all academic and scholarly assignments with fairness and honesty.

Show up  We work as a team in this class, so attendance is required.  Give yourself a chance to learn by coming to class and I will try to make it interesting once you get there. 2.  Be prepared  opportunity, but you can prepare to respond.  In this class, I will provide the opportunity and you need to be prepared.  Your preparation creates an environment for all to learn. 3.  Pay attention  Our complex world is full of noises and signals. To discern signals, you have to pay attention to details and context. In this class, we will employ your eyes, ears, and minds for the purpose of learning. You will be encouraged to pay attention with all of them.   4.  Think out-loud  Asking questions is part of collaborative learning and problem solving, and that is what we do in this class. You need to think for yourself, but not by yourself. Be ready to reflect, comment, share ideas, or offer a counter-point.   5.  Collaborate and iterate  Business environments employ teams to solve problems or discover innovative solutions. In this class, I encourage you to work together, form a point-of-view quickly, support it or change it based on what you learn, then repeat the process early and often.
